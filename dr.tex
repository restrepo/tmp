The interpretation of neutrino experimental data in terms of neutrino oscillatiobs  is compatible with both Majorana and Dirac neutrino masses. Regarding the last possibility,it is worth noticing that the lack of signals in the ongoing neutrinoless double beta decay experiments left  open the possibility that the total Lepton number $L$ can be a symmetry of nature. However, introducing a set of right handed neutrinos with with (global) $L=-1$,
such that the Majorana terms are forbidden, requires Yukawa cuplings much more smaller than the other which give the other standard model masses.

To explain the smallness of neutrino masses it is expected that they appear as a realization of at least a  dimension five operator. The only dimension five operator in the Standard Model (SM) violates total $L$  by two units and therefore is not suitable to explain the smallneaa of Dirac neutrino masses.

In this work we assune that total $L=L_e+L_\mu+L_\tau$ arise as the remnant of a local  Abelian symmetry, spontaneoualy broken by the vacuum expectation value (vev) of a singlet scalar $S$ whose imaginay part is eaten up by a massive extra gauge boson.

In this extension of the standar model, the dimension five operator which conserves total Lepton number is~\cite{}
\begin{align}
  \mathcal{L}=
  \frac{h_{\alpha i}}{\Lambda} (\nu_{R_\alpha})^\dagger \epsilon_{ab}L^a H^b S + \text{h.c}\,,
\end{align}
where $\nu_{R_i}$ are the right-handed part of the neutrino Dirac fermions , $H$ is the SM higgs doublet with $1/2$ hypercharge we need to add at least two right handed neutrinos, 
We assume from now on that the charges under the new Abelian group forbids both
\begin{align}
  & h_\nu(\nu_R)^\dagger \epsilon_{ab}L^a H^b\,,&\text{and }&
  \nu_R \nu_R\.
\end{align}
In this way,  the tree level mass for both the Dirac and Majorana neutrinos are forbidden. In particular, this excludes the aolution with Lepton parity as a renmant symmetry, under which the right-handed neutrinos, $\nu_R$, and the standard model leptons have charge $-1$.

%Something about B-L fot allow minimal number of fields

To have a similar status than Majorana neutteonos as a realization of the Weinberg operator, we consider the new Dirac operator in the context of a local $\operatorname{U}(1)$
